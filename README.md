# Ares - CSGO Cheat

Ares is a cheat program designed for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO). The aim of this project is to enhance the CSGO gaming experience and add some additional features. Ares offers two primary features: Bunny Hopping (Bhop) and GlowESP.

## Features

### 1. Bunny Hopping (Bhop)
Bunny hopping is a technique in CSGO that allows players to move faster and escape enemy fire more easily. Ares automates this feature, enabling players to bunny hop more skillfully.

### 2. GlowESP
GlowESP assists in determining the position and status of enemy players. Ares makes it easier to spot enemy players by adding a glow effect around them. This feature provides tactical advantages to players.

## How to Use

Using Ares is straightforward:
1. Launch CSGO.
2. Run Ares.
3. When you enter the game, the Bhop and GlowESP features will be enabled automatically.

**Note:** Using this cheat program is against CSGO rules and may result in being kicked or banned from the game. Therefore, it is recommended to use Ares only at your own risk and on private servers.
